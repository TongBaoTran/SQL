--The object of the game is to start with any actor or actress who has been in a movie and
--connect them to Kevin Bacon in the smallest number of links possible. Two people are
--linked if theyâ€™ve been in a movie together. We do not consider links through television
--shows, made-for-tv movies, writers, producers, directors, etc. For example, you might
--wonder how Alfred Hitchcock can be connected to Kevin Bacon. One answer is that:
--Alfred Hitchcock was in Show Business at War (1943) with Orson Welles, and
--Orson Welles was in A Safe Place (1971) with Jack Nicholson, and
--Jack Nicholson was in A Few Good Men (1992) with Kevin Bacon!
--Then we can count how many links were necessary and assign the actor or actress a Bacon number.
--Finds all actors and actresses with a maximum bacon number of two
